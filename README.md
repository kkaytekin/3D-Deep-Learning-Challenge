# AT3DCV - 3D Deep Learning Challenge
An task completed for the first phase of the Practical: Advanced Topics for 3D Computer Vision in TU Munich

Containts four small architectures for 3D Object Classification:
* Point-cloud network
* 3D-Convolution network
* Point-cloud network with spatial embedding augmentation.
* Hybrid network with multi-modal input (point cloud and voxel grid)

A report of the results can be found as PDF in the `bonus` branch.
